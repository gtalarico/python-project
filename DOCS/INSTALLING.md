# Installing Python

## Windows

- Download the installer from Python.org
- Install it for "All Users", and install on `C:\Pyhon37`.
- Ensure `C:\Pyhton37` and `C:\Pyhton37\Scripts` are added to your `PATH` Variable. This can be done automatically during the install by selecting a checkbox, but if you missed it you can add it manually without any side effects.

## MacOS

I highly recommend using [PyEnv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) for installing and managing and installing your Python Versions. See project repo for installation instructions.
